ðŸ¤– Project Newt

Project Newt is a personal robotics project aimed at developing a companion robot with remote control, autonomous navigation, and interactive features.
The goal is to start small â€” differential drive, joystick control, servo-based pan/tilt â€” and gradually scale up to higher-level control with ROS2, SLAM, and web-based monitoring.

ðŸ“Œ Project Roadmap
âœ… Completed

Implemented differential drive control

Joystick control for motors

Joystick control for pan-tilt servos (neck movement)

Added ESP-NOW communication for remote control

Started CAD modeling of the robot

ðŸš§ In Progress

Mechanical assembly of the robot chassis

Integration of subsystems (drive, servos, comms)

ðŸ”œ Next Steps

Test remote drive + pan/tilt controls

Integrate with ROS2 for higher-level control

Add SLAM (camera-based mapping)

Add obstacle avoidance sensors

Develop web interface for monitoring/teleop

Expand towards companion features (e.g., gestures, interaction)
